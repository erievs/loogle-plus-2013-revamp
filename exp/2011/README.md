#Google Plus theme

The purpose of this HTML5+CSS3 theme is to setup a Google Plus like theme. It may be interesting
for people developing products based on Google Plus, and would like to make the product familiar
for Google Plus users. 

#Requirements

The theme has been tested in Chrome and Firefox.

#The plan

I would like to cover all the different layouts of Google Plus, however I know that I won't have
time for that. This is my very first github project, pull requests, ideas, recommendations are
welcome. I'll try to respond all of them.

#About me

I'm a web developer, entrepreneur, a father and so. Feel free to contact me:
